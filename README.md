# toto_tracker
A Python "app" to track toto betting statistics and help you make betting decisions.


Add your Veikkaus account credentials to credentials file!

Right now works only with specific race ID.

TODO:
Multiple tracking targets.
Webapp maybe with Flask? Gonna need a backend.
Send email after results are in.
Time management. Cron?
